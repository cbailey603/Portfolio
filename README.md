# Hello! Welcome to my portfolio repository

My name is Connor Bailey. I am a recently graduated data analyst and am looking for full-time employment. I earned my M.S. in Applied Economics, with a Data Analysis Certificate, from Boston College in 2023 and am excited to apply my skills in a professional setting. Previously, having obtained a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from UCONN in 2016, I worked in product development. More specifically, I worked at an international lighting manufacturing company, starting as a product marketing associate in 2017 and eventually as a product manager from 2020 to 2021. In 2021 I decided to shift my career trajectory towards economics and data analysis, as these topics were of personal interest and aligned with my skill sets.  

### Projects 

Through my schoolwork and personal projects, I have amassed a portfolio that demonstrates my capabilities in all aspects that are necessary to thrive as a data analyst in a professional environment.
